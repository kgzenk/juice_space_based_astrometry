Meta-kernel for JUICE Dataset v422 -- baseline 150lb CReMA 5.1 20230130_002
============================================================================

   This meta-kernel lists the JUICE baseline 150lb CReMA 5.1 SPICE kernels
   that provide information for the baseline 150lb CReMA 5.1 scenario.

      - Launch on April, 5th 2023

   The kernels listed in this meta-kernel and the order in which
   they are listed are picked to provide the best data available and
   the most complete coverage for the JUICE baseline 150lb CReMA 5.1 scenario.

   The scenario is based on the following OEM file provided by Mission
   Analysis:

      JUICE_CReMA5d1_Baseline_0001.oem

   This meta-kernel was generated with the Auxiliary Data Conversion
   System version: ADCSng v3.6.3.


Usage of the Meta-kernel
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This metakernel is only for science operations analysis at this stage.

   Note that a default Attitude profile has been implemented for the whole
   mission by the following C-Kernels:

      juice_sc_crema_5_1_150lb_23_1_default_vnn.bc
      juice_sc_crema_5_1_150lb_23_1_comms_vnn.bc
      juice_sc_crema_5_1_150lb_23_1_conjctn_vnn.bc
      juice_sc_crema_5_1_150lb_23_1_flybys_vnn.bc
      juice_sc_crema_5_1_150lb_23_1_baseline_vnn.bc

   Please note that the order in which the previous kernels are loaded is
   important. The *_default_* kernel implements the default attitude
   during the main phases of the mission (interplanetary transfer,
   Jupiter Tour and Ganymede Phase) this kernel needs to be loaded first
   and is followed by *_comms_* which provides a baseline of the
   communications attitude (required to perform an 8 hours daily pass with
   Malargue). If desired this kernel can be removed to omit this attitude.

   In order to generate this attitude, we consider JUICE to be visible
   from MALARGUE when JUICE has elevation above 10 degrees in the MALARGUE
   topocentric reference frame MALARGUE_TOPO.

   Next a CK implementing the Conjunction phases is set with a default
   conjunction orientation. Finally the *_flybys_* kernel is loaded which
   includes the default S/C orientation for the planetary swing-bys and
   moon fly-bys.

   The *_baseline_* kernel provides the combined attitude from the other
   kernels and includes slews in between the different attitudes as
   generated by OSVE/AGM. This kernel, if present, has the higher priority
   and overwrites the S/C attitude provided by all the other kernels.

   Reading the comments of the binary C-Kernels is very helpful to
   understand the implemented attitude. You can use the following NAIF
   command line utility to extract that information from the kernels:

      > commnt -r juice_sc_*.bc

   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use
   of this kernel must "load" the kernel normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates the data items with
   their names in a data structure called the "kernel pool". The SPICELIB
   routine FURNSH loads a kernel into the pool.

   The kernels listed below can be obtained from the ESA SPICE Web server:

      https://spiftp.esac.esa.int/data/SPICE/JUICE/kernels/

   or from the ESA SPICE FTP server:

      ftp://spiftp.esac.esa.int/data/SPICE/JUICE/kernels/


Implementation Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   IMPORTANT: this trajectory is designed using the latest Jupiter Moons
   ephemeris data as provided by the IMCCE - so called IMCCE L2 model

   DISCLAIMER: Please note that the current kernels are pre-operational and
   they are subject to change.

   It is recommended that users make a local copy of this file and
   modify the value of the PATH_VALUES keyword to point to the actual
   location of the JUICE SPICE data set's ``data'' directory on
   their system. Replacing ``/'' with ``\'' and converting line
   terminators to the format native to the user's system may also be
   required if this meta-kernel is to be used on a non-UNIX workstation.
